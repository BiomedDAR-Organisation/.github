## Biomedical Data Architecture & Repository

### Research
BioMed DAR is a SSSO (Standard Systems Support Office) that provides clinical research data management support and governance framework to strategic A*STAR BMRC programmes; Briefly, DAR manages the data life cycle of the cohort datasets through 3 operatives - data governance, data management operations (cleaning, integration, cataloguing, movement, usage) and s/w development. DAR builds and uses its own in-house data warehouse, data catalogue, data visualizers and secured data exchange API libraries. In-house s/w builds allow us to adapt and integrate data management or governance workflow into our systems easily. Currently, DAR helps to host IAF programs like ATTRaCT, CaLiBre, WCIT and GUSTO. 

On data security (See Figure 1), it is important to note that DAR does not store identifiable datasets and works with clinical data stakeholders to import only de-identified data into BII. Meanwhile, DAR operates within the BII ISO27001 certified environment for hosting its data warehousing, ETL processes and data sandboxes where strict SOP are in place to track data movement. Physically, the ISO27001 servers are located in designated server rooms where staff movement are logged and captured through CCTV. As an additional measure, the ISO27001 servers are caged up to pose further deterrence to the physical access of the disk drives.
